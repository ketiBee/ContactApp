ContactApp is aspp made with Angular frontend and ASP.Net Web API backend. It allows user to add, update and delete contacts. When adding a new contact user can 
put person's name, multiple numbers and emails, adress etc.
Contact details are stored in SQL database and fetched with GET request to be displayed to user. 
When user wants edit his contacts, he can edit all of the properties except number and email. I wasn't able to make that functionality work.
